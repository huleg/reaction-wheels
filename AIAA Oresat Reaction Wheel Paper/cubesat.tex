\section{Introduction}
Small educational satellites have been launched by dozens of universities around the United States as part of NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative (CLSI), especially under the auspices of the Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program. As of 2015 CubeSats from 29 states have flown under the program, however the great state of Oregon has yet to join their ranks\cite{Mahoney:15bk}. During the summer of 2015 the Oresat project was initiated by the Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) to rectify this situation. PSAS is an engineering student organization and citizen science project located at Portland State University dedicated to developing low-cost, open-source, and open-hardware high-powered rockets and avionics systems with special interests in venture class launch vehicle technologies and nanosatellites\cite{PSAS:15bk}.\\

The Oresat satellite will follow the ``2U" CubeSat standard \cite{Cubesat:14bk}. A CAD render of the Oresat concept is pictured in Figure \ref{fig:oresat}. The primary objectives of the project are to test several subsystems in the environment of a 400 km circular Low Earth Orbit: the ``Low Gain Radio (LGR)" communication board and the highly tolerant ``System Controller" board. The LGR is the main low-gain radio system based on a 436 MHz radio system using the MKW01Z128 microcontroller with built in sub-1GHz radio. The System Controller is being designed expressly for the space environment, and will include some measure of fault-tolerance and radiation hardening.

The secondary mission goal is to run an educational outreach project in the state of Oregon. Called ``DxWiFi", after the Amateur Radio ``Dx" code for distance, OreSat will broadcast a live video feed from space to the ground using the standard 2.4 GHz  802.11b ``WiFi" protocol. DxWiFi ground stations will be built by Oregon high schools using 3D printers, common-off-the-shelf WiFi adapter cards, and existing augmented reality cellphone apps that track satellites.

A severely power limited ($\sim$ 1 W) S-band downlink from LEO unfortunately requires high gain antennas, both on the ground and on the space vehicle. However, in order to minimize required deployables on the space vehicle, and to provide for the general simplicity of design, construction, and operation of future ground stations, we chose a 16 turn Helical with approximately 15 dBi gain. This gives a relatively broad beam width antenna, requiring pointing, but only on the order of a 5-10 degrees. Since nadir pointing will only allow a few seconds of data link, Oresat must "point and stare" at a ground station that has requested to download video. This degrees-per-second slew of the antenna (and camera) requires rapid pointing changes that magnetorquers simply can not provide. Following from this is the need for a robust system to provide attitude control for Oresat attitude control system. PSAS has selected a reaction wheel based system to provide attitude control for Oresat. Per PSAS’s open-source mandate all (non-ITAR) project development deliverables are being made publicly available under a GNU GPL v2 license\cite{Oresat:15bk}. It is hoped by the authors, and the members of PSAS that the discourse around educational CubeSats and their design will be elevated by making the information for this project publicly available.

\section{Concept Definition}
	Angular rate and pointing precision requirements for the flight attitude control system are determined from orbital parameters (likely those offered by Nanoracks deployment from the ISS) and the expected performance of the PSAS DxWiFi telemetry system. The ground test article is a proof of concept and uses inexpensive COTS DC brushless motors which are significantly more powerful than those required for the flight use case. The ground test article is broadly similar in design to the flight system, for example by using 4 momentum-wheels in a pyramid configuration for added redundancy and on-orbit mission assurance. Such a design is similar one recently developed for a master's thesis project at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo\cite{Logan:08bk}. A magnetorquer will be used to periodically dump accumulated momentum into the Earth's magnetic field. The principle difference between the ground test and flight designs is that the ground test article uses the 1U form factor whereas Oresat will be 2U.

\section{Design and Fabrication}
	The Oresat reaction wheel system chassis was developed using rapid prototyping techniques over a short time period (approximately 8 weeks). This approach enables rapid design iteration cycles. A mockup 1U CubeSat structure was drafted in SolidWorks CAD, and fabricated using a FDM 3D printer. Mounted on the 3D-printed chassis are the 4X DC brushless motors, a 4-cell Li-Po battery pack, IMU shield, Intel Edison microcontroller and accompanying Arduino breakout. This `ground' test article is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rcs}. As previously noted there are several departures in the design of the ground test article from the flight system. Among these are COTS DC brushless motors used to drive the momentum wheels; having a very high RPM limit, specifically 22,000 RPM, these motors provide substantially more torque, shaft power, and shaft speed than required by the flight system. The use of such motors is justified by the need to ground test the controllers ability to react quickly to perturbations, and to test the limits of the controller rise time. In practice, the ground test article is not constrained by requirements for power consumption, or heat generation as the flight system surely will be.

\section{Controls Simulation and Design}
The controller for the reaction wheel system is a PI loop implemented on an Intel Edison with code written in Python. The Edison receives feedback from a 9-DoF IMU and sends signals via GPIO to the motors. The top-level controller design procedure was as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the transfer functions from dynamics analysis of free body diagrams of the system
\item Create simulation in GNU Octave
\item Design the controller using iterative testing (with comparisons to the model) and classical Bode techniques
\end{enumerate}
The transfer functions are determined with a dynamics analysis of the free body diagram, shown schematically for a single axis in Figure \ref{fig:FBD}. The forces acting on the cube are the torques created by the motors $T_i^0$, damping effects $b_1 \dot{\theta}_{cube}$, and spring effects $G_1 \theta_{cube}$. Summing the moments around the center of gravity gives the following equation:\\

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:moment}
\sum M_0^{+ \circlearrowleft} = I_{x,cube} \ddot{\theta}_{x,cube} = T^0_{Ax} + T^0_{Bx} - T^0_{Cx} - T^0_{Dx} + T^0_x - \dot{\theta}_{x,cube} - G_x \theta_{x,cube}
\end{equation}\\
	
Solving Eqn. \ref{eq:moment} so that $\theta_{cube}$ and its derivatives are on the left side, and the motor torques are on the right side, as well as setting the system to Standard Equilibrium Position (at SEP the input perturbations are set to zero) and substituting the torque-inertia relation:\\

\[
T^0_x = 0
\]
\[
T^0_{nx} = I_{rw}\ddot{\theta}_n\]\\

This gives us the following equation:\\
 
\[
I_{x,cube} \alpha_x + b_x \dot{\theta}_{x,cube} + G_x \theta_{x,cube} = \sin(45^{\circ}) I_{rw} (\ddot{\theta}_A + \ddot{\theta}_B -\ddot{\theta}_C - \ddot{\theta}_D)
\]\\	
Per the textbook definition of a transfer function we have the output of a system with respect to a single input, so all motors are set to zero except for one (A for this example) and apply a Laplace transform to the equation:\\

\[
\frac{I_{x,cube}}{\sin(45^{\circ}) I_{rw}} \theta_{x,cube} s^2 +
\frac{b_x}{\sin(45^{\circ}) I_{rw}} \theta_{x,cube} s +
\frac{G_x}{\sin(45^{\circ}) I_{rw}} \theta_{x,cube} = \theta_A s^2
\]\\
	
Finally moving $\theta_{cube}$ and $\theta_A$ to the left side of the equation and everything else to the right, gives us a transfer function:\\

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:xfer}
G_A(s)=\frac{\theta_{x,cube}(s)}{\theta_A(s)}=\frac{s^2}{\cfrac{I_{x,cube}}{\sin(45^{\circ}) I_{rw}}s^2 + \cfrac{b_x}{\sin(45^{\circ}) I_{rw}}s + \cfrac{G_x}{\sin(45^{\circ}) I_{rw}}}
\end{equation}\\
	
Using the transfer functions, given schematically for one axis by Eqn. \ref{eq:xfer} a simulation was created in GNU Octave which yielded step response plots shown in Figure \ref{fig:simulation}. The simulation will further aid in Bode analysis for the determination of stability margins. These relate the frequency response of the system to its time response. The margins can be adjusted with the use of a controller to affect the time response characteristics of the system. In the case of the ground test system the rise time for a $90^{\circ}$ step input should be under 1 second.

\section{Testing}
An exciting testing opportunity involves exploiting the high-quality $\mu$-gravity environment of Portland State University's Dryden Drop Tower (DDT) facility for free fall tests of the reaction wheel system. The Dryden Drop Tower, patterned on the 2.2 Second Drop Tower facility at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, is optimized for exceptionally fast drop turnaround times. The DDT is one of the most productive drop towers in the world for its class, with more than 5800 drops over its 6 year history. The DDT's 2.1 seconds of free-fall conditions provide unique opportunities for the observation of phenomena that are usually masked at the macro-scale in 1-g gravity fields. The relative quality of the $\mu$-gravity environment of a drop tower is very high compared to those offered by parabolic flights (generally $10^{-5}$ or $10^{-6}$-g for the drop tower compared to $10^{-1}$ or $10^{-2}$-g for a parabolic flight. In this high quality $\mu$-gravity the CubeSat attitude control can be tested in an environment similar to that of space (at least in an inertial sense). In the DDT the reaction wheel system testing program involved a random ( 25 \% duty cycle PWM) perturbing impulse followed by a command to damp this roll in the brief cinderella-like moment before the simulacrum of $\mu$-gravity disappears 2.1 seconds later. A a time lapse plot showing the initial roll impulse and subsequent damping is presented in Figure \ref{fig:lapse}. On a qualitative examination of the simulated roll response compared to the experimental gyro rates from the IMU the model appears to be quite accurate (in terms of the frequency and damping ratio), at least for this particular impulse. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:drop_results}. The 0.1 s phase shift between the gyro data and the angular rates predicted by the simulation may be due to the discrete time lag of the physical controller. The gyro data is presented here in an unfiltered form. 

Following from the first test, an initial modicum of model validation allows us to continue with the model as the basis for further iterative controls testing. We plan to select a series of additional test points to formulate a more complete Bode diagram. This will require drop tests at several additional frequencies. Once the Bode diagram is completed a new model can be backed out, and the iterative controller design loop can be started anew. This work is in progress (as of August, 2016), and should be completed before the Oresat Critical Design Review in November 2016 which is concurrent with the next round of NASA ELaNa proposals.
