\item {\bf Mission: STEM outreach by sending live video space-to-ground to tracking stations built and operated by Oregon high schools}
\item Ground stations will be built using 3D printers, COTS WiFi adapter cards, and existing augmented reality cellphone apps that track satellites
\item S-band downlink at approximately 15 dBi gain. Needs to ``point-and-stare" at ground stations with {\bf 5-10$^{\circ}$ of pointing at 1 deg/s of slew}
\item Will use a {\bf{reaction wheel}} based system to provide attitude control
